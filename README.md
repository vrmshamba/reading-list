   - Why Persia's moment mattered

2. [The Calculus Evolution](docs/02-calculus-evolution.md)
   - Classical to Multivariable to Tensor Calculus
   - The branching point: Graph Calculus vs Causal Calculus
   - Integration in modern AI

### Part II: Graph Neural Networks
3. [GNN Part 1: Foundations and Mathematics](docs/03-gnn-part-1-foundations.md)
   - Nodes, edges, and topology
